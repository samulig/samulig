Hi, 

samulig here! I'm a recently graduated Bachelor of Engineering in ICT. 

I'm developing my skills in programming, and this GitHub account is used to keep track of my progress. 

In school, I was focusing on embedded systems, and learned C and Python to some degree. But I have come to realize, I need more 
practice in coding, and it is crucial for my future in this field.
